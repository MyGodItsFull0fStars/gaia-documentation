Content delivery networks (CDN) serve a specific region by storing copies of an original video closer to the consuming devices which reduces network congestion and improve the transmission times.

## Energy Consumption

Within the [Conventional Approach](energy/approaches/Conventional%20Approach.md), the energy consumption of data centres is estimated with an energy intensity per viewing hour of $1.3 Wh/hour$.

The equation for energy consumption related to data centres is as follows:
$$ED_{C}= ID_{C}\times D$$
Where $ED_C$ denotes the data centres energy consumption, $ID_C$denotes the energy intensity of data centres and $D$ denotes the duration of video streaming.
