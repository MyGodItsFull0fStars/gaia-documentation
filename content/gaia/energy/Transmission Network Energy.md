title: "Transmission Network Energy"
---

Transmission network energy intensity is used to relate the network energy that was consumed to a metric.
Transmission network energy intensity estimates are usually derived from academic literature that evaluates the energy consumption of a transmission network and the volume of data that was transmitted through the network.

In the [Conventional Approach](energy/approaches/Conventional%20Approach.md) it relates to the data volume that was transmitted through the network.
