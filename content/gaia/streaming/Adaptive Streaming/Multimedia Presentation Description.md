Multimedia Presentation Description (MPD) is used by a DASH client to learn about metadata regarding available content on a server. 

	The MPD consists of one or multiple periods, where a period is an interval of the program along the temporal axis.
A period contains a starting time, duration and one or more adaptation sets.



In [MPEG-DASH](content/gaia/streaming/Adaptive%20Streaming/MPEG-DASH.md) the characteristics are described by MPD, which is an XML document.
